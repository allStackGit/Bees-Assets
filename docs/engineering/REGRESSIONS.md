# Bees Permanent Regression Ledger

This file records fixed regressions that future work must not reintroduce. It is intentionally different from `BUG_LEDGER.md`:

- `BUG_LEDGER.md` contains current unresolved validated findings and should become empty as work is completed.
- This file contains durable root-cause/protection knowledge for regressions that have been fixed.

Do not use this as a chronological activity log. Add an entry when a real regression teaches a reusable lesson or needs permanent protection. Consolidate duplicate root causes.

## Required entry format

```markdown
### REG-001 — Short regression name
**Area:** subsystem/files/contracts involved  
**Symptom:** externally observable failure that revealed the regression  
**Root cause:** underlying technical reason, not merely the line that was wrong  
**Permanent protection:** focused automated test(s) that fail if the regression returns, or the strongest practical manual/system protection and why automation is impractical  
**Verification:** validation level that demonstrates the protection exercises the intended contract  
**Invariant/knowledge:** durable document or invariant updated because of the lesson, if applicable
```

Entries must not be added with an empty root cause, permanent protection, or verification field. If the cause is still unknown or the defect is still open, keep it in the active task/bug ledger instead of pretending it is permanently protected.

## Closure rule

A reproducible fixed regression is not fully closed until:

1. the underlying cause is understood;
2. a focused automated regression test exists whenever practical;
3. the test would have failed for the defective behavior rather than merely asserting the new implementation shape;
4. broader validation appropriate to the risk has been performed when execution is available;
5. any reusable ownership/lifecycle/architecture lesson is added to the appropriate invariant or durable-memory document.

Manual-only protection is acceptable only when the record explains why deterministic automation is not practical and names a concrete repeatable validation procedure.

### REG-001 — Screen-space UI remained tied to the 1366x768 authoring rectangle
**Area:** `Scripts/UI Components/ResponsiveScreenLayoutGuard.cs`, `Scripts/UI Components/RootCanvasCompatibilityGuard.cs`, root screen-space canvases, large legacy `RectTransform` wrappers, dynamically instantiated UI canvases  
**Symptom:** UI that was correct at the historic 1366x768/16:9 authoring size remained misplaced or failed to use the available screen correctly on Macs and other displays with different resolutions/aspect ratios.  
**Root cause:** the first responsive repair recognized only exact reference-sized containers with children. It therefore skipped leaf backers and large screen-relative frames such as 1366x668 layouts, and scene-load-only installation missed root canvases instantiated later. Protecting `LayoutGroup` children from independent reanchoring was necessary but not sufficient: on taller logical canvases, a full-screen vertical layout could still keep its original fixed child heights, leaving unused space that exposed the root backer below a fixed footer.  
**Permanent protection:** `Tests/EditMode/ResponsiveScreenLayoutGuardTests.cs` behaviorally exercises full-screen leaf panels, full-width/near-full-height frames with preserved margins, one-axis bars, and ordinary centered panels that must not be stretched. Late-created root canvases are discovered with the Unity-version-supported `Object.FindObjectsByType<Canvas>` API, and the shared discovery host installs both responsive-wrapper and final compatibility guards. `RootCanvasCompatibilityGuardTests` protects layout-owner stretching, layout-child non-interference, and the 718+50-style main-body/footer case where taller-display surplus must be assigned to the dominant body rather than left as an exposed strip.  
**Verification:** run the `BeesFoundation` EditMode category to execute the geometry regressions, then perform a representative rendered PlayMode/player check at 16:9, 16:10, 3:2, 4:3 and ultrawide sizes (including the affected Mac display). Runtime execution is still required after this remote change.  
**Invariant/knowledge:** `docs/engineering/INVARIANTS.md` defines resolution/aspect-ratio independence, late-created root-canvas coverage, the distinction between viewport-like wrappers and ordinary centered panels, and layout-owner versus layout-child geometry ownership.

### REG-002 — Responsive UI fix referenced an unavailable Canvas API
**Area:** `Scripts/UI Components/ResponsiveScreenLayoutGuard.cs`, `Tests/EditMode/ResponsiveScreenLayoutGuardTests.cs`, Unity API compatibility  
**Symptom:** the project failed compilation with `CS0117: 'Canvas' does not contain a definition for 'allCanvases'`.  
**Root cause:** the late-created-canvas discovery path was written against an assumed `Canvas.allCanvases` API without verifying that API against the repository's current Unity version. The source-level regression test repeated the same invalid assumption, so the impact/test review did not catch the compile contract.  
**Permanent protection:** the discovery path now uses Unity 6's supported `Object.FindObjectsByType<Canvas>(FindObjectsInactive.Include, FindObjectsSortMode.None)`. The focused source regression explicitly requires that API and rejects `Canvas.allCanvases`; normal Unity compilation remains the authoritative protection against unavailable engine APIs.  
**Verification:** compile/import the project in the documented Unity version (`6000.5.4f1`) before running the `BeesFoundation` EditMode category; then perform the rendered cross-resolution UI checks required by REG-001. This remote change has not itself been compiled or executed.  
**Invariant/knowledge:** `docs/engineering/INVARIANTS.md` requires new Unity engine APIs to be verified against the repository's documented Unity version before use.

### REG-003 — Non-16:9 UI edge ownership remained incomplete
**Area:** `Scripts/UI Components/GameHudLayoutGuard.cs`, `Scripts/UI Components/ResponsiveScreenLayoutGuard.cs`, `Scripts/UI Components/RootCanvasCompatibilityGuard.cs`, gameplay HUD, Squad Maker, Level Intro and other root-canvas screens  
**Symptom:** repeated display testing first exposed clipped/misaligned legacy UI, then a follow-up gameplay repair introduced a new visible regression: the scoreboard, ordinary Game Speed, selected-squad action box and mini map were pulled inward from the gameplay borders, while squad-number tabs appeared on top of the scoreboard instead of immediately to its right.  
**Root cause:** distinct edge contracts were conflated. Navigation controls such as Back/Continue/Skip benefit from a small rendering margin, but the gameplay HUD is intentionally authored flush to the canvas edges; applying the same 10-unit inset to gameplay controls changed the intended layout. The live `Space` scene also carries a stale `GameMenus.Scoreboard` reference to the inactive Summary panel rather than the actual Scoreboard prefab, so the squad-tab calculation treated the scoreboard as hidden. Once the real scoreboard is resolved, the Squad Tabs and scoreboard are sibling UI branches, so their geometry must be converted through world space rather than calculated as though the scoreboard were a descendant of the stretched Squad Tabs root. The viewport/body/footer issue remains a separate root-layout ownership concern handled by `RootCanvasCompatibilityGuard`.  
**Permanent protection:** `GameHudLayoutGuard` uses zero gameplay edge margin and explicitly pins the actual live scoreboard and ordinary Game Speed to the top corners, the selected-squad action box to bottom-left, and the mini map to bottom-right. The guard validates the assigned scoreboard object name and falls back to the live root-canvas child named `Scoreboard`, preventing the stale Summary reference from controlling gameplay layout. The Squad Tabs root still fills the live canvas, but its first-tab offset converts the resolved scoreboard's right edge through world space into Squad Tabs local space before adding the tab gap; when the scoreboard is hidden, the row starts at the top-left canvas edge. `RootCanvasCompatibilityGuard` remains the separate owner of viewport-level body/footer repair and the 15-unit margin for explicit navigation controls. `GameHudLayoutGuardTests` behaviorally protects stale-reference scoreboard resolution, sibling scoreboard/tab geometry, zero hidden-scoreboard fallback, flush corner pinning and the zero gameplay margin; `RootCanvasCompatibilityGuardTests` continues to protect root-layout and navigation-margin behavior.  
**Verification:** compile/import in Unity `6000.5.4f1`, run `BeesFoundation`, then render representative gameplay at 16:9 and non-16:9 sizes. Verify the scoreboard and ordinary Game Speed are flush with the top edges, squad numbers begin immediately to the scoreboard's right, the action box/minimap are flush with the bottom corners, and the timed Pluto IV/Titania II HUD remains correctly grouped. Also repeat Level Intro/Squad Maker checks to confirm their separate navigation/layout protections remain intact. Remote edits still require this Unity execution and rendered validation.  
**Invariant/knowledge:** `docs/engineering/INVARIANTS.md` and `docs/engineering/SYSTEM_MAP.md` distinguish flush gameplay HUD edges from navigation-control margins, record live-scoreboard resolution and sibling-space scoreboard/tab geometry, and preserve the separate viewport-layout ownership contract.

### REG-004 — Shared Pluto/Titania timed shield HUD drifted apart
**Area:** `Scripts/Levels/Level.Campaign.Pluto4.cs`, `Scripts/Levels/Level.Titania2Enhancements.cs`, `Scripts/UI Components/GameHudLayoutGuard.cs`, `Scripts/UI Components/ResponsiveScreenLayoutGuard.cs`, Pluto IV and Titania II timed shield HUD  
**Symptom:** the green planetary-shield health fill could escape its rectangle, and later Pluto IV displayed Game Speed far to the left of the otherwise compact Planetary Shield/timer/Evacuated cluster. Titania II uses the same shield and timer controls, so a Pluto-only placement repair could regress Titania II.  
**Root cause:** generic responsive island translation originally moved pieces of the authored shield hierarchy independently. A follow-up repair then preserved Pluto IV with an absolute `-290` Game Speed x-position. That fixed one authored-size arrangement but detached Game Speed from the live shield geometry, so later responsive scaling made the fixed inset visibly wrong. The shared Pluto/Titania health-bar control also intentionally uses an established `0..150` scale convention and must not be reinterpreted as a Pluto-only `0..1` transform.  
**Permanent protection:** generic responsive repair does not translate ordinary HUD islands. Pluto IV clamps the health fraction before applying the shared `fraction * 150` convention. `GameHudLayoutGuard` now derives Pluto IV Game Speed placement from the live Planetary Shield and Evacuated-counter geometry: it right-aligns with the shield and top-aligns with the counter, falling back below the shield when no counter is visible. Titania II separately right-aligns Game Speed below the clock with its intended gap. The guard contains no Pluto-specific absolute x inset, and restores ordinary authored Game Speed placement whenever the mission clock is hidden. `GameHudLayoutGuardTests.TimedShieldAlignmentMathPreservesReferenceEdgesAndGap` behaviorally protects the geometry helpers, while the Pluto and Titania source-wiring regressions protect the two mission states and the shared shield-scale convention.  
**Verification:** compile/import in Unity `6000.5.4f1`, run the `BeesFoundation` EditMode category, then render both missions at representative 16:9 and non-16:9 sizes. For Pluto IV, check the timed state with Planetary Shield, timer, Evacuated counter and Game Speed together, including full/partial/depleted shield states and the transition out of the clock state. For Titania II, check Planetary Shield, timer and Game Speed with the counter hidden, again through changing shield health and mission completion.  
**Invariant/knowledge:** `docs/engineering/INVARIANTS.md` records that Pluto IV and Titania II share the Planetary Shield/timer cluster, while Pluto IV additionally owns the Evacuated counter; layout changes to this cluster must validate both missions.
