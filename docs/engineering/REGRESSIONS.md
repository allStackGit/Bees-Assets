# Bees Permanent Regression Ledger

This file records fixed regressions that future work must not reintroduce. It is intentionally different from `BUG_LEDGER.md`:

- `BUG_LEDGER.md` contains current unresolved validated findings and should become empty as work is completed.
- This file contains durable root-cause/protection knowledge for regressions that have been fixed.

Do not use this as a chronological activity log. Add an entry when a real regression teaches a reusable lesson or needs permanent protection. Consolidate duplicate root causes.

## Required entry format

```markdown
### REG-001 — Short regression name
**Area:** subsystem/files/contracts involved  
**Symptom:** externally observable failure that revealed the regression  
**Root cause:** underlying technical reason, not merely the line that was wrong  
**Permanent protection:** focused automated test(s) that fail if the regression returns, or the strongest practical manual/system protection and why automation is impractical  
**Verification:** validation level that demonstrates the protection exercises the intended contract  
**Invariant/knowledge:** durable document or invariant updated because of the lesson, if applicable
```

Entries must not be added with an empty root cause, permanent protection, or verification field. If the cause is still unknown or the defect is still open, keep it in the active task/bug ledger instead of pretending it is permanently protected.

## Closure rule

A reproducible fixed regression is not fully closed until:

1. the underlying cause is understood;
2. a focused automated regression test exists whenever practical;
3. the test would have failed for the defective behavior rather than merely asserting the new implementation shape;
4. broader validation appropriate to the risk has been performed when execution is available;
5. any reusable ownership/lifecycle/architecture lesson is added to the appropriate invariant or durable-memory document.

Manual-only protection is acceptable only when the record explains why deterministic automation is not practical and names a concrete repeatable validation procedure.

### REG-001 — Screen-space UI remained tied to the 1366x768 authoring rectangle
**Area:** `Scripts/UI Components/ResponsiveScreenLayoutGuard.cs`, `Scripts/UI Components/RootCanvasCompatibilityGuard.cs`, root screen-space canvases, large legacy `RectTransform` wrappers, dynamically instantiated UI canvases  
**Symptom:** UI that was correct at the historic 1366x768/16:9 authoring size remained misplaced or failed to use the available screen correctly on Macs and other displays with different resolutions/aspect ratios.  
**Root cause:** the first responsive repair recognized only exact reference-sized containers with children. It therefore skipped leaf backers and large screen-relative frames such as 1366x668 layouts, and scene-load-only installation missed root canvases instantiated later. Later fixes correctly avoided rewriting `LayoutGroup` children, but that still left a second ownership gap: a viewport-level layout owner/backer could remain attached to stale reference geometry even though its children were protected.  
**Permanent protection:** `Tests/EditMode/ResponsiveScreenLayoutGuardTests.cs` behaviorally exercises full-screen leaf panels, full-width/near-full-height frames with preserved margins, one-axis bars, and ordinary centered panels that must not be stretched. Late-created root canvases are discovered with the Unity-version-supported `Object.FindObjectsByType<Canvas>` API. `RootCanvasCompatibilityGuardTests` additionally protects the rule that the viewport-level layout owner itself may be stretched to the actual canvas while a child driven by a `LayoutGroup` must remain untouched.  
**Verification:** run the `BeesFoundation` EditMode category to execute the geometry regressions, then perform a representative rendered PlayMode/player check at 16:9, 16:10, 3:2, 4:3 and ultrawide sizes (including the affected Mac display). Runtime execution is still required after this remote change.  
**Invariant/knowledge:** `docs/engineering/INVARIANTS.md` defines resolution/aspect-ratio independence, late-created root-canvas coverage, the distinction between viewport-like wrappers and ordinary centered panels, and layout-owner versus layout-child geometry ownership.

### REG-002 — Responsive UI fix referenced an unavailable Canvas API
**Area:** `Scripts/UI Components/ResponsiveScreenLayoutGuard.cs`, `Tests/EditMode/ResponsiveScreenLayoutGuardTests.cs`, Unity API compatibility  
**Symptom:** the project failed compilation with `CS0117: 'Canvas' does not contain a definition for 'allCanvases'`.  
**Root cause:** the late-created-canvas discovery path was written against an assumed `Canvas.allCanvases` API without verifying that API against the repository's current Unity version. The source-level regression test repeated the same invalid assumption, so the impact/test review did not catch the compile contract.  
**Permanent protection:** the discovery path now uses Unity 6's supported `Object.FindObjectsByType<Canvas>(FindObjectsInactive.Include, FindObjectsSortMode.None)`. The focused source regression explicitly requires that API and rejects `Canvas.allCanvases`; normal Unity compilation remains the authoritative protection against unavailable engine APIs.  
**Verification:** compile/import the project in the documented Unity version (`6000.5.4f1`) before running the `BeesFoundation` EditMode category; then perform the rendered cross-resolution UI checks required by REG-001. This remote change has not itself been compiled or executed.  
**Invariant/knowledge:** `docs/engineering/INVARIANTS.md` requires new Unity engine APIs to be verified against the repository's documented Unity version before use.

### REG-003 — Non-16:9 UI edge ownership remained incomplete
**Area:** `Scripts/UI Components/GameHudLayoutGuard.cs`, `Scripts/UI Components/ResponsiveScreenLayoutGuard.cs`, `Scripts/UI Components/RootCanvasCompatibilityGuard.cs`, gameplay HUD, Squad Maker, Level Intro and other root-canvas screens  
**Symptom:** on the affected Mac/aspect ratios, squad-number tabs were still displaced from the actual top-left, bottom controls such as Level Intro BACK/CONTINUE were visibly clipped, and some screens still exposed a large white strip below the authored content. Earlier fixes made the same screens look correct on another resolution, so a single successful screenshot did not prove the cross-display contract.  
**Root cause:** the first responsive passes overreached by translating arbitrary nested UI, which broke authored sibling/layout relationships. The correction then became too conservative: it protected `LayoutGroup` children but did not guarantee that the viewport-level layout owner/backer itself filled the real canvas; it also configured the Squad Tabs layout group without a final post-layout pin of the container's rendered bounds. Finally, root-canvas interactive islands had no narrow last-resort correction when their rendered bounds still landed outside the actual canvas.  
**Permanent protection:** `ResponsiveScreenLayoutGuard` remains wrapper-only and must not translate arbitrary nested islands. `RootCanvasCompatibilityGuard` runs after the responsive and gameplay HUD passes and repairs only ownership boundaries: screen-sized `LayoutGroup` owners/backers are stretched to their parent viewport, a whole direct root-canvas interactive island is translated only if its rendered bounds are actually outside the canvas, and the legacy `Squad Tabs` container is final-pinned to the actual canvas top-left after Unity layout has rebuilt it. `RootCanvasCompatibilityGuardTests` behaviorally protects layout-owner stretching, layout-child non-interference, exact out-of-bounds clamping, in-bounds stability, and final top-left pinning.  
**Verification:** compile/import in Unity `6000.5.4f1`, run `BeesFoundation`, then repeat the supplied Mac checks rather than relying on the Windows/other-resolution screenshots: Level Intro BACK/CONTINUE must be fully visible; gameplay squad numbers must sit at the actual top-left; selected-squad action box and mini map must remain fully visible; Squad Maker must retain its correct footer/START/TEST relationship; and no white strip may remain at the bottom. Repeat at a normal 16:9 size to catch regressions introduced by the compatibility pass. Rendered validation is required because final Unity layout-pass ordering and platform window behavior cannot be proven by EditMode geometry tests alone.  
**Invariant/knowledge:** `docs/engineering/INVARIANTS.md` now distinguishes viewport-level layout ownership from layout-child ownership, permits only whole-island correction for actually clipped direct root-canvas controls, and requires final squad-tab top-left placement after layout.

### REG-004 — Shared Pluto/Titania timed shield HUD drifted apart
**Area:** `Scripts/Levels/Level.Campaign.Pluto4.cs`, `Scripts/Levels/Level.Titania2Enhancements.cs`, `Scripts/UI Components/GameHudLayoutGuard.cs`, `Scripts/UI Components/ResponsiveScreenLayoutGuard.cs`, Pluto IV and Titania II timed shield HUD  
**Symptom:** the green planetary-shield health fill could escape its rectangle, and later Pluto IV displayed Game Speed far to the left of the otherwise compact Planetary Shield/timer/Evacuated cluster. Titania II uses the same shield and timer controls, so a Pluto-only placement repair could regress Titania II.  
**Root cause:** generic responsive island translation originally moved pieces of the authored shield hierarchy independently. A follow-up repair then preserved Pluto IV with an absolute `-290` Game Speed x-position. That fixed one authored-size arrangement but detached Game Speed from the live shield geometry, so later responsive scaling made the fixed inset visibly wrong. The shared Pluto/Titania health-bar control also intentionally uses an established `0..150` scale convention and must not be reinterpreted as a Pluto-only `0..1` transform.  
**Permanent protection:** generic responsive repair does not translate ordinary HUD islands. Pluto IV clamps the health fraction before applying the shared `fraction * 150` convention. `GameHudLayoutGuard` now derives Pluto IV Game Speed placement from the live Planetary Shield and Evacuated-counter geometry: it right-aligns with the shield and top-aligns with the counter, falling back below the shield when no counter is visible. Titania II separately right-aligns Game Speed below the clock with its intended gap. The guard contains no Pluto-specific absolute x inset, and restores ordinary authored Game Speed placement whenever the mission clock is hidden. `GameHudLayoutGuardTests.TimedShieldAlignmentMathPreservesReferenceEdgesAndGap` behaviorally protects the geometry helpers, while the Pluto and Titania source-wiring regressions protect the two mission states and the shared shield-scale convention.  
**Verification:** compile/import in Unity `6000.5.4f1`, run the `BeesFoundation` EditMode category, then render both missions at representative 16:9 and non-16:9 sizes. For Pluto IV, check the timed state with Planetary Shield, timer, Evacuated counter and Game Speed together, including full/partial/depleted shield states and the transition out of the clock state. For Titania II, check Planetary Shield, timer and Game Speed with the counter hidden, again through changing shield health and mission completion.  
**Invariant/knowledge:** `docs/engineering/INVARIANTS.md` records that Pluto IV and Titania II share the Planetary Shield/timer cluster, while Pluto IV additionally owns the Evacuated counter; layout changes to this cluster must validate both missions.
