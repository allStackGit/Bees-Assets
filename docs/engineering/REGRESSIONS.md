# Bees Permanent Regression Ledger

This file records fixed regressions that future work must not reintroduce. It is intentionally different from `BUG_LEDGER.md`:

- `BUG_LEDGER.md` contains current unresolved validated findings and should become empty as work is completed.
- This file contains durable root-cause/protection knowledge for regressions that have been fixed.

Do not use this as a chronological activity log. Add an entry when a real regression teaches a reusable lesson or needs permanent protection. Consolidate duplicate root causes.

## Required entry format

```markdown
### REG-001 — Short regression name
**Area:** subsystem/files/contracts involved  
**Symptom:** externally observable failure that revealed the regression  
**Root cause:** underlying technical reason, not merely the line that was wrong  
**Permanent protection:** focused automated test(s) that fail if the regression returns, or the strongest practical manual/system protection and why automation is impractical  
**Verification:** validation level that demonstrates the protection exercises the intended contract  
**Invariant/knowledge:** durable document or invariant updated because of the lesson, if applicable
```

Entries must not be added with an empty root cause, permanent protection, or verification field. If the cause is still unknown or the defect is still open, keep it in the active task/bug ledger instead of pretending it is permanently protected.

## Closure rule

A reproducible fixed regression is not fully closed until:

1. the underlying cause is understood;
2. a focused automated regression test exists whenever practical;
3. the test would have failed for the defective behavior rather than merely asserting the new implementation shape;
4. broader validation appropriate to the risk has been performed when execution is available;
5. any reusable ownership/lifecycle/architecture lesson is added to the appropriate invariant or durable-memory document.

Manual-only protection is acceptable only when the record explains why deterministic automation is not practical and names a concrete repeatable validation procedure.

## Entries

_No permanent regression entries have been backfilled here yet. Add verified historical regressions incrementally when their root cause and current protection can be confirmed from repository evidence; do not reconstruct them from conversational memory alone._
